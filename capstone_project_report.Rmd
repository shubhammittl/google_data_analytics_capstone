This report is based on Case-study: **How Can a Wellness Technology
Company Play It Smart?**. Please refer to Appendix for details.

# Business task
The goal of this project is to improve marketing strategy of Bellabeat’s wellness tracker - Leaf Chakra. This project will analyze the usage data of non-Bellabeat trackers’ consumers to find key patterns and relationships.  The key insights drawn from the analysis will be applied to Leaf Chakra for its promotion. The final deliverable will be high-level marketing recommendations based on those key insights.

## Data Sources

In addition to FitBit Fitness Tracker Data contributed by Mobius on Kaggle, 7 
more data sets were collected for better analysis, as described next.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
kable(read_excel("datasets_used.xlsx"),
      caption = "Description of data sources used")
```
*Note: In the remainder of the report, the data-sets are referred using the first name of their contributors*

## Data Checkup

Note: The focus of checkup was primarily on the daily activity, sleep & hear-rate data.  
Following is the data-check summary.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
kable(read_excel("data_checkup.xlsx"),
      caption = "Summary of Data checkup")
```
None of the datasets proved to be *good* datasets during checkup. 
Nevertheless, we should move on to exciting analysis ahead.

# Data Processing

Summary:  

1. Inspect each dataframe for missing values.  
2. Standardize the column names.  
3. Remove erroneous outliers.  
4. Convert data values into consistent metrics.  
5. Merge & split columns as required  
6. Fix typos  
7. Sort records  
8. Remove machine-dependent/ irrelevant columns  

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# list of ids alloted to individuals within datasets
alket_id <- 1
arooj_id <- 2
josh_id <- 3
damir_id <- 4
parul_id <- 5
bekbolat_id <- 6
```

Let's process data-frames of each dataset one by one.

                     bekbolat_activity, .id = 'dataset_num')

sleep <- bind_rows(mobius_sleep, arooj_sleep,
                   damir_sleep,parul_sleep,
                     bekbolat_sleep, .id = 'dataset_num')

heartrate <- bind_rows(mobius_heartrate,
                       josh_heartrate,parul_heartrate,
                     bekbolat_heartrate, .id = 'dataset_num')

body <- bind_rows(mobius_body, arooj_body, damir_body,
                  .id = 'dataset_num')
```

### Assign unique IDs to consumers

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
paste("Total number of unique IDs in Activity data =",n_unique(activity$id))
unique(activity$id)

longer_ids <- unique(activity$id)[-c(36:41)]
```
Most of the consumer ID's are 10-digit numbers. Let's shorten these ID's.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dfs = list(activity, heartrate, sleep, body)
for (i in 1:length(dfs)) {
  dfs[[i]] <- dfs[[i]] %>%
  mutate(id = plyr::mapvalues(id, from = longer_ids, to = c(7:41),
                        warn_missing = FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  select(-c(dataset_num)) %>%
  arrange(id,date)
}
activity <- dfs[[1]]
heartrate <- dfs[[2]]
sleep <- dfs[[3]]
body <-dfs[[4]]
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis {.tabset}

### Activity Data {-}
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
paste('Total number of consumers having activity-log:',n_unique(activity$id))
print('Columns in the activity data:') 
colnames(activity)
skim_without_charts(activity)
```
The activity data is complete in terms of `steps` and `calories` columns, while other columns do have missing values.  
These missing values will be dealt according to the use case in further analyses.

#### Distribution of daily activity records amongst consumers
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
options(repr.plot.width = 15,repr.plot.height = 9)
activity %>% 
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize( num_of_records = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=id, y = num_of_records, fill =id))+ 
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = 'How much daily activity data we have per consumer?',
       subtitle = "Number of daily activity records by consumer",
       x = 'Consumer ID',
       y = 'Number of records')+
  geom_text(aes(x=id, y = num_of_records,label=num_of_records, vjust = -.25), size = 3)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/eda_activity.png")
```
The activity data is highly skewed in terms of number of daily records per individual.
Consumer no. 4 has more than 1500 records while Consumer 40 has just 8 records.  

### Sleep data {-}
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
paste('Total number of consumers having sleep-log:',n_unique(sleep$id))
print('Columns in sleep data:')
colnames(sleep)
skim_without_charts(sleep)
```

The sleep data is complete in terms of `sleep_time`. However, other columns do have missing values.  

#### Distribution of daily sleep records amongst consumers

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sleep %>% 
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize( num_of_records = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=id, y = num_of_records, fill =id))+ 
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = 'How much daily sleep data we have per consumer?',
       subtitle = "Number of daily sleep records by consumer",
       x = 'Consumer ID',
       y = 'Number of records')+
  geom_text(aes(x=id, y = num_of_records,label=num_of_records, vjust = -.25), size = 3)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/eda_sleep.jpeg")
```

Only 28 consumers have sleep records and the distribution of number of daily records is highly skewed, similar to the activity records.

### Heart-rate data {-}
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
paste('Total number of consumers having heartrate-log:',n_unique(heartrate$id))
print('Columns in heartrate data:')
colnames(heartrate)
head(heartrate)
```

#### Distribution of daily pulse-rate records amongst consumers
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
heartrate %>% 
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize( num_of_records = n_unique(date)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=id, y = num_of_records, fill =id))+ 
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = 'How much daily heart-rate data we have per consumer?',
       subtitle = "Number of daily heart-rate records by consumer",
       x = 'Consumer ID',
       y = 'Number of records')+
  geom_text(aes(x=id, y = num_of_records,label=num_of_records, vjust = -.25), size = 3)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/eda_heartrate.png")
```
The heartrate data is available for only 17 consumers. The distribution of number of daily records per consumer is skewed.

### Body data {-}

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
paste('Total number of consumers having body-data log:',n_unique(heartrate$id))
print('Columns in body data:')
colnames(body)
head(body)
```
Only 17 consumers out of 41 have their body-parameters log.  

#### Distribution of daily body records amongst consumers

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
body %>% 
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize( num_of_records = n_unique(date)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=id, y = num_of_records, fill =id))+ 
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = 'How much daily body data we have per consumer?',
       subtitle = "Number of daily body records by consumer",
       x = 'Consumer ID',
       y = 'Number of records')+
  geom_text(aes(x=id, y = num_of_records,label=num_of_records, vjust = -.25), size = 3)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/eda_body.png")
```

The body-data is also highly skewed amongst 17 consumers.


## Relationship amongst attributes of activity data {.tabset}

We will explore the relation between some pairs of attributes.

### Distance vs Steps {-}

```{r, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
activity %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = steps, y = distance))+
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = 'Distance traversed vs Steps taken by consumers',
      x = 'Step count', y = 'Distance traversed')+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave('distance_vs_steps.png')
```

**Finding: The number of steps and distance travelled are exactly linear.**

### Calories burnt vs Total Active-time {-}
```{r, message = FALSE}
activity %>% 
  mutate(total_active_time = fairly_active_minutes + lightly_active_minutes +
           very_active_minutes) %>% # Compute total active-time
  filter(total_active_time != 0) %>% 
  # Remove the outlier
  filter(!near(total_active_time,625, 10)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_active_time, y = calories))+
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = 'Calories burnt vs total active-time',
       x = 'Total active-time (minutes)',
       y = 'Calories burnt')+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave('calories_vs_activity.png')
```

**Finding:**  
More minutes of activity implies more calories burnt.

### Calories burnt vs Step count {-}
```{r, message = FALSE}
activity %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = steps, y = calories))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = 'Calories burnt vs Step count',
       x = 'Number of steps', y = 'Calories burnt')+
theme(legend.position = "none")
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggsave("saved_plots/calories_vs_steps.png")
```

**Finding:**
There appears 2 segment of users: 
1. average_burners : who burn normal calories per step taken
2. intense_burners: who burn aggressively per step taken

Let's plot the distribution of how aggressively users burn calories per step

#### Distribution of calories per step
```{r, message = FALSE}
activity %>% 
  mutate(calorie_per_step = calories/steps) %>% 
  filter(calorie_per_step<0.5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=calorie_per_step, y=..density..))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, colour="black", fill="white")+
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="red")+
  labs(x = 'Calorie burnt per step', y = 'Density',
       title = 'Distribution of calorie per step')+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(calorie_per_step)),
             color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1)+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10)+
  geom_label(aes(x=mean(calorie_per_step), y= 6,
            label=paste("Mean =",round(mean(calorie_per_step),3))))+
  geom_label(aes(x = 2*mean(calorie_per_step), y = 7.5, label = 'Intense burners', size = 3))+
  geom_label(aes(x = 0.5* mean(calorie_per_step), y= 7.5, label = 'Average burners', size = 3))+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/distribute_calories_per_step.png")
```
Since the distribution is bimodal, consumers can be segmented using the mean as shown.  
Average burners burn less than 0.127 calorie/step, while Intense burners burn greater than 0.127 calorie/step.

Let's plot the calories vs steps trends for both segments.

#### Calories vs Steps trends for the two consumer segments:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
activity %>% 
  mutate(calorie_per_step = calories/steps) %>% 
  mutate(burner_type = case_when(
    calorie_per_step <= 0.127 ~ 'Average',
    TRUE ~ 'Intense'
  )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = steps, y = calories, color = burner_type))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Calories-vs-Steps Trends for two consumer segments",
       x = 'Daily step count', y = 'Calories burnt')

ggsave("saved_plots/calories_vs_steps_segments.png")
```

**Finding:**  
The rate of burning calories per step is much higher in one segment of users than the other.

As per [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html), a person can be categorized into 3 categories according to Body Mass Index (BMI).

#### Body-type of consumers surveyed
```{r, message=FALSE}
body_types <- body %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(body_mass_index = round(mean(bmi))) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(body_type = case_when(
    body_mass_index < 25 ~ 'Healthy',
    body_mass_index %in% c(25,30) ~ 'Overweight',
    TRUE ~ 'Obese'
  ))
body_types
```
Let's plot the calories vs steps trend for each body_type.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
activity %>% 
  merge(body_types, by = 'id') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = steps, y = calories, color = body_type))+
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Calories-vs-Steps trends for body-types",
       x = 'Daily step count', y = 'Calories burnt')

ggsave("saved_plots/bodywise_calories_vs_steps.png")
```

**Finding:**
Obese and Overweight consumers burn calories more aggresively as compared to healthy consumers.  
* Aggressive burners = Obese + Overweight  
* Average burners = Healthy


## Average daily activity of consumers
Let's summarize the daily activity done by each consumer, by averaging over all his/her available daily records.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
avg_daily_activity <- activity %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(avg_steps = mean(steps),
            avg_cal = mean(calories),
            avg_dist = mean(distance), 
            avg_sedentary_min = mean(sedentary_minutes),
            avg_fair_active_min = mean(fairly_active_minutes),
            avg_very_active_min = mean(very_active_minutes),
            avg_light_active_min = mean(lightly_active_minutes),
            avg_sedentary_dist = mean(sedentary_active_distance),
            avg_fair_active_dist = mean(moderately_active_distance),
            avg_very_active_dist = mean(very_active_distance),
            avg_light_active_dist = mean(light_active_distance))
head(avg_daily_activity)
```

### Distribution of average daily activity amongst consumers
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
avg_cal_plot <- ggplot(avg_daily_activity)+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=avg_cal, y=..density..),
                 binwidth = 200, colour="black", fill="white")+

            label= paste("Mean=",round(mean(avg_cal)))))+
theme(legend.position = "none")
               
avg_steps_plot <- ggplot(avg_daily_activity)+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=avg_steps, y=..density..),
                 binwidth = 1000, colour="black", fill="white")+
  geom_density(aes(x= avg_steps),alpha=.2, fill="red")+
  labs(x = 'Average daily step-count', y = 'Density',
       title = 'Distribution of Avg Daily Steps',
      tag = 'B')+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(avg_steps)),
             color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1)+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10)+
  geom_label(aes(x=mean(avg_steps), y=0.0002,
            label= paste("Mean=",round(mean(avg_steps)))))+
theme(legend.position = "none")

avg_dist_plot <- ggplot(avg_daily_activity %>% drop_na())+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=avg_dist, y=..density..),
                 binwidth = 1, colour="black", fill="white")+
  geom_density(aes(x= avg_dist),alpha=.2, fill="red")+
  labs(x = 'Average daily distance (km)', y = 'Density',
       title = 'Distribution of Avg Daily Distance',

theme(legend.position = "none")

grid.arrange(avg_cal_plot, avg_steps_plot, avg_dist_plot, ncol = 2)

ggsave("saved_plots/distribute_avg_daily_activity.png")
```
**Findings:**
1. On an average, a consumer of smart-device covers a distance of 5 kilometers by walking 6925 steps and burns around 2.1 kilo-calories per day.  
2. Few consumers have daily average of less than 500 calories.

[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/pdf/postcurriculum_session8.pdf) recommends 10000 steps and a distance of around 8 kilometers daily for good health. 


#### Why is daily calorie average of few consumers less than 500 daily calories?
Let's look at the individual daily-calories trend of those consumers to find out why.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
less_than_500cal_users <- avg_daily_activity %>%
    filter(avg_cal < 500)%>%
    select(id)
print("Consumers burning less than 500 daily calories on an average:")
less_than_500cal_users

activity %>% merge(less_than_500cal_users, by.y = TRUE) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=date, y = calories)) + 
    geom_line(alpha = 0.7, color = 'darkblue') + geom_point(color='black', alpha = 0.5)+
  facet_wrap(~id, scales = "free")+
labs(title = 'Trends of calories for consumers burning less than 500 calories as daily average',
    x = 'Date', y = 'Calories burnt')+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/less_cal_individual_trends.png")
```

It is observed that Consumer-2 always had daily calories burnt under 250 calories with few days of zero-calories.  
Consumers 4, 5 & 6 had many days where their tracker recorded zero-calories.

**Finding:**
Some consumers have less than 500 calories of daily average due to:  
1. Zero calories recorded by the device on some days, and/or  
2. Too few calories burnt each day.

#### Are there any other consumers having zero-calorie records?
Let's find out the proportion of daily records having zero-calorie readings for each consumer
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
activity %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(total_days = n(), zero_cal_days = sum(calories== 0)) %>% 
  mutate(percent_of_zero_cal = round(zero_cal_days*100/total_days,2)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col( mapping = aes(x= id, y = percent_of_zero_cal, fill = id)) +
  labs(title = 'How frequent are zero-calories readings?',
       subtitle = "Percentage of daily records with zero-calories by consumers",
       x = 'Consumer ID',
       y = 'Proportion of records with zero-calories')+
  geom_text(aes(x= id, y = percent_of_zero_cal, 
                label = paste0(round(percent_of_zero_cal),'%'), vjust = -0.25),
            size = 3)+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/zero_cal.png")
```

12 out of 41 consumers under analyses had 2-35 % days of zero-calorie records.

A Smart-device consumer may have upto 35 % of records with calories recorded as zero.
This may happen due to variety of reasons:
1. The user may have forgot to wear the tracker.
2. The user didn't switch on the tracker
3. Tracker malfunctioned.
4. User spends some days in restricted areas like exam hall where smart devices are prohibited.


#### Are the zero-calorie readings dependent upon the day?

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
activity %>%
  mutate(day = weekdays(date)) %>%
  group_by(id,day) %>% 
  summarize(percent_of_zero_cal = 100*sum(calories==0)/n(),)  %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarize(avg_percent = mean(percent_of_zero_cal))%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(day, levels = c('Monday','Tuesday',
                                                        'Wednesday','Thursday',
                                                        'Friday','Saturday',
                                                        'Sunday')),
                         y = avg_percent))+
  geom_line(color = 'darkblue',aes(group =1)) + geom_point()+
  labs(subtitle = "Percentage of Zero-Calories vs Day",
       title = 'Is the zero-calorie reading dependent upon the day?',
       x = '', y = 'Proportion of zero-calorie occurences')+
  geom_label(aes(x= day, y = avg_percent, 
                label = paste(round(avg_percent,1),'%')), 
             size = 3)+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/daywise_zero_cal.png")
```

The percentage of zero-calories readings are fairly constant (varies from `0.6` to `2.4 %`) across weekdays, indicating little to no-correlation between zero-calories reading and day.

**Finding:**
Zero-calories readings are not dependent upon the day.

#### Are there any consumers with zero-steps readings on some day?
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
activity %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(total_days = n(), zero_steps_days = sum(steps== 0)) %>% 
  mutate(percent_of_zero_steps = round(zero_steps_days*100/total_days,2)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col( mapping = aes(x= id, y = percent_of_zero_steps, fill = id)) +
  labs(title = 'Do consumers have zero-steps readings?',
       subtitle = "Percentage of daily records with zero-steps by consumers",
       x = 'Consumer ID',
       y = 'Proportion of records with zero-steps')+
  geom_text(aes(x= id, y = percent_of_zero_steps, 
                label = paste0(round(percent_of_zero_steps),'%'), vjust = -0.25), size = 3)+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/zero_steps.png")
```

A consumer may have upto 75% of the days with zero-steps recorded.  
Let's look at the distribution of zero-steps readings amongst users.
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
activity %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(total_days = n(), zero_steps_days = sum(steps== 0)) %>% 
  mutate(percent_of_zero_steps = round(zero_steps_days*100/total_days,2)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=percent_of_zero_steps, y=..density..))+ 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, colour="black", fill="white")+
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="red")+
  labs(x = 'Percentage of zero-steps records', y = 'Density',
       title = 'How frequent are Zero-Step records?')+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(percent_of_zero_steps)),
             color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1)+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10)+
  geom_label(aes(x=mean(percent_of_zero_steps), y=0.05,
            label= paste("Mean=",round(mean(percent_of_zero_steps)))),
            size = 3)+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/zero_steps_distribution.png")
```

**Finding:**
On an average, a consumer has `12 %` of daily records with number of steps recorded as zero.

#### Are the zero-steps readings dependent upon the day?
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
activity %>%
  mutate(day = weekdays(date)) %>%
  group_by(id,day) %>% 
  summarize(percent_of_zero_steps = 100*sum(steps==0)/n(),)  %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarize(avg_percent = mean(percent_of_zero_steps))%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(day, levels = c('Monday','Tuesday',
                                                        'Wednesday','Thursday',
                                                        'Friday','Saturday',
                                                        'Sunday')),
                         y = avg_percent))+
  geom_line(color = 'darkblue',aes(group =1)) + geom_point()+
  labs(subtitle = "Percentage of Zero-Steps vs Day",
       title = 'Is the zero-step reading dependent upon the day?',
       x = '', y = 'Proportion of zero-step occurences')+
  geom_label(aes(x= day, y = avg_percent, 
                label = paste(round(avg_percent,1),'%')),
             size = 3)+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/daywise_zero_steps.png")
```

**Findings:** 
There is no such particular day at which steps are not tracked. However, steps are tracked most regular on Wednesday.


## Device usage statistics

### Total time of daily device usage
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
avg_daily_activity %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(total_device_time = avg_sedentary_min + avg_light_active_min+
              avg_fair_active_min + avg_very_active_min) %>%

```

The histogram depicts the bimodal distribution of device usage, where either the device is used around 1400 minutes frequently or around 1000 minutes.

**Finding:**  
On an average, a consumer uses device for 1217 minutes, i.e., roughly 20 hours daily.

Lower device-usage time may be due to:  
1. Frequent charging requirement  
2. User forgot to put on the tracker  

Now, let's see how this device use time is distributed accross different activities.

### Device-time distribution across different intensity of activities

```

**Finding:**
On an average, a consumer spends 1004 minutes (16.7 hours) in sedentary activities,
182 minutes (3 hours) in light, 15 minutes in moderate, while 19 minutes in intense activities.

Higher sedentary time daily may pose risk to the metabolic health of an individual, especially sitting for prolonged periods ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404815/)).  

[Experts recommend](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/sitting/faq-20058005) taking a break from sitting every 30 minutes.  


## Day dependence of user activity

### Dependence of sedentary period on the day of week?

Let's plot the average daily sedentary time of users vs day to find out.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
activity %>% 
  mutate(day = weekdays(date)) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(id, day) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sed_time = mean(sedentary_minutes)) %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarize(daywise_sed_time = mean(avg_sed_time)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(day, levels = c('Monday','Tuesday',

                                            'Sunday')), 
             y = daywise_sed_time, group =1))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(title = 'Average Daily Sedentary minutes by Day',
                   x = '', y = 'Average Sedentary Time (min)')+
  geom_label(aes(label = round(daywise_sed_time)),size = 3)+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/daywise_sedentary.png")
```

**Finding:**
On an avearge, consumers spend least time seated on Saturdays, while they sit longest on Mondays.


### Dependence of consumer's active-time on the day of week {.tabset}
Let's plot the daywise trend of average step-count, light-active time, fairly-active time & very-active time to find out.
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

**Finding:** 
On an average, consumers are most active on Saturdays and least active on Sundays.


## Sleep data availability

How often daily sleep data is recorded as compared to compared to daily activity data?
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sleep_summary <- sleep %>% 
  merge(data.frame(id = c(1:41)), all = TRUE) %>%

**Finding:**
On an average, a consumer has 34% of his/her daily records having both sleep and activity data.


## Sleep-time statistics

### Distribution of sleep-duration across consumers

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sleep %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sleep_time = mean(sleep_time)) %>% 
  ggplot() +

ggsave("saved_plots/sleep_time_distribution.png")
```

**Findings:** 
1. On an average, a consumer sleeps for `356 minutes`, i.e., roughly `6 hours` daily.  
2. Some consumers have average daily sleep less than 240 minutes.

[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html) recommends more than 7 hours of sleep per night for adults.

### Proportion of consumers with inadequate sleep

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sleep %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sleep_time = mean(sleep_time)) %>% 
  summarize(n_less_sleep = sum(avg_sleep_time < 420)/n_unique(id),
            n_adequate_sleep = sum(avg_sleep_time >= 420)/n_unique(id))
```

**Finding:**
60% of the consumers under study had inadequate sleep


### Daily trends for consumers with average sleep less than 4 hours.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sleep %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sleep_time = mean(sleep_time)) %>% 
  filter(avg_sleep_time < 240) %>%

    y = 'Sleep time in minutes')+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/less_sleepy_consumers.png")
```

**Finding:**
Few users do not track their sleep on most days.


## Day dependence of consumer's sleep-time

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggsave("saved_plots/daywise_sleep.png")
```

**Finding:**
Consumers sleep longest on Saturday & Sundays, which is obvious due to the greater amount of leisure available on weekends.

## Sleep efficiency of consumers

### Are consumers too much awake during bed-time?

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sleep %>% 
  filter(sleep_time != 0) %>% 
  select(id,wake_time, bed_time, sleep_time) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(id) %>%

  labs(x = 'Average minutes of wake-time', y = 'Density',
       title = 'Are consumers too much awake while on bed?',
       subtitle = 'Distribution of wake-time amongst consumers')+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(avg_wake_time)),
             color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1)+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10)+
  geom_text(aes(x=mean(avg_wake_time), y= 0.03,

theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/wake_time_distribution.png")
```

**Finding:**
On an average, a consumer spends 38 minutes being on bed but not sleeping.

### How much proportion does wake-time take of the total bed-time?

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sleep %>% 
  filter(sleep_time != 0) %>% 
  select(id,wake_time, bed_time, sleep_time) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(avg_wake_time = mean(wake_time), avg_bed_time = mean(bed_time)) %>% 
  mutate(wake_time_percent = avg_wake_time*100/avg_bed_time) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x= wake_time_percent, y=..density..),binwidth = 10, 
                 colour="black", fill="white")+
  geom_density(aes(x= wake_time_percent), alpha=.2, fill="red")+
  labs(x = 'Proportion of bed-time wasted (%)', y = 'Density',
       title = 'How much proportion does wake-time take of the total bed-time?',
       subtitle = 'Distribution of Percentage of bed-time wasted')+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(wake_time_percent)),
             color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)+

theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/bed_time_wasted.png")
```

**Finding:**  
A consumer wasted 8% of their total bed time on an average while awake.

Sleep efficiency can be improved by:  
1. Meditation practices to relax for better sleep.  
2. Cutting-off from using digital displays around 2 hours prior to usual bed-time ([Reference](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-tips-to-sleep-better#2.-Reduce-blue-light-exposure-in-the-evening))

## Quality of consumer's sleep
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
print('Number of consumers with sleep-type data:')
sleep %>% 
  select(id,deep_sleep_time, sleep_time, shallow_sleep_time) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(num_of_consumers = n_unique(id))
```

**Finding:**
Only 3 consumers have sleep-quality data.
Deep sleep, also referred to as REMS (Rapid Eye Movement Sleep), is important for proper repair of body and mind ([refer](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-much-deep-sleep-do-you-need#:~:text=early%20aging-,Takeaway,8%20hours%20of%20nightly%20sleep.)).
The quality of sleep can be determined by the duration of REMS a consumer has.

ggsave("saved_plots/hr_availability.png")
```

**Finding:**
On an average, a consumer records daily heartrate one-fourth times as compared to recording the daily activity.

## Comprehensiveness of daily heartrate record

It is expected that heart-rate is recorded every hour. Are the available daily heartrate records complete?

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
hourly_hr_availability %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(avg_hours_count = mean(hours_count))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_hours_count, y= ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 4, 
                 colour="black", fill="white")+
  geom_density( alpha=.2, fill="red")+
  labs(x = 'Hours of recorded heartrate', y = 'Density',
       title = 'Distribution of hours of heartrate available')+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(avg_hours_count)),
             color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 12)+
  geom_label(aes(x=mean(avg_hours_count), y= 0.05,
            label=paste("Mean =", round(mean(avg_hours_count)))), size = 3)+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/hr_comprehensiveness.png")
```

**Finding:**
On an average, 16 hours of heartbeat was recorded daily by a consumer.

Certain heart-rate ranges are more efficient for metabolising fats during workouts ([Refer](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/serious-about-your-workouts-get-a-heart-rate-monitor/)). This may be hightly beneficial to obese and overweight persons with fat-reducing targets. 

Tracking pulse-rate can help determine general cardiovascular health of an individual; whether heart-rate remains in the safe levels of bpm each day.   

## Relationship between daily calories burnt & daily heartrate

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
daily_heartrate %>% 
  merge(activity, all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(id, avg_heartrate, min_heartrate, max_heartrate, dev_heartrate,
         calories) %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = avg_heartrate,y = calories))+
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()+
geom_vline(aes(xintercept= 90),
             color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)+
labs(title = 'Is daily calories burnt related to daily heartrate ?',
    subtitle = 'Calories burnt vs Average heartrate',
    y = 'Calories burnt', x = 'Average daily heartrate')+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/cal_vs_hr.png")
```

**Finding:**
The higher average heartrate is associated with higher amount of calories burnt till 90 bpm heartrate.
Beyond 90 bpm, the proportionality relation ceases to exist, and calories burnt decrease with higher heartrate.

It seems that consumers with moderate activity throughout the day burnt more calories as compared to vigorously exercising individuals. However, strong conclusion can't be drawn as notion of 'high' or 'low' heartrate depends on age of an individual, the consumer attribute which is left unrecorded by all fitness trackers.  

The safe zones of heart-rate are decided by the age of individual, as recommended by [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/heartrate.htm). Hence, adding the age to the bodily parameters will be highly effective to fully use heartrate data.

## Body data availability

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
body_data_availability <- body %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(body_days_count = n_unique(date))
  
daily_activity_availability <- activity %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(activity_days_count = n())

merge(body_data_availability, daily_activity_availability, all = TRUE) %>% 
mutate(body_days_count = coalesce(body_days_count, 0)) %>% 
mutate(body_by_activity_percent = body_days_count*100/activity_days_count) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = body_by_activity_percent, y= ..density..)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, 
             colour="black", fill="white")+
geom_density( alpha=.2, fill="red")+
labs(x = 'Proportion of days with both body & activity records (%)', y = 'Density',
       subtitle = 'Availability percent of body data per consumer',
      title = 'How much body data is available as compared to compared to daily activity data?')+
geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(body_by_activity_percent)),
         color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)+
scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10)+
geom_label(aes(x=mean(body_by_activity_percent), y= 0.05,
        label=paste("Mean =",round(mean(body_by_activity_percent)))), size = 3)+
theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave("saved_plots/body_data_availability.png")
```

**Finding:**
On an average, a consumer records daily body-data less than one-tenth times as compared to recording the daily activity.

The individual attributes: weight and height are important to determine the Body-Mass Index, an important factor for determining calories and steps goals.  Knowledge of body-parameters can be helpful for personalized recommendations to consumers.


# Key Insights
1. Less than 50% of consumers tracked their heart-rate and body-parameters(height, weight, fat, etc), in addition to activity and sleep.
2. Consumers missed upto 35% of times tracking their daily calories & upto 75% of times their daily step count.
3. There are 2 segments of users: 'average burners' and 'intense burners'. Intense-burners,comprising of overweight and obese consumers, burnt higher number of calories for the same number of steps as compared to average burners who are healthy consumers.
4. Duration of REM sleep was not tracked for most of the users.  
5. On an average, a consumer  
 * covered a distance of 5 kilometers by traveling 6925 steps and burnt around 2.1 kilo-calories per day. This is too less than recommended by CDC for good health.  
 * used tracker for 20 hours a day.  
 * spent 16.7 hours in sedentary, 3 hours in light, 15 minutes in moderate, and 19 minutes in intense activity.  
 * spent time seated the most on Mondays, while least on Saturdays.  
 * was the most active on Saturday and the least on Sundays.  
 * tracked sleep one-third times he/she tracked daily activity.  
 * slept for 6 hours daily, which is less than recommended sleep of more than 7 hours.  
 * slept longest (more than 7 hours) on Sunday.  
 * wasted 8% of their total bed-time being awake.  
 * tracked heart-rate one-fourth of the days he/she tracked activity.  
 * tracked only 16 hours of heart-rate in a day.   
 * recorded daily body-data less than one-tenth times as compared to recording the daily activity.
