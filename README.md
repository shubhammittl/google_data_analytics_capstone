## Case-study: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

### Introduction  

Welcome to the Bellabeat data analysis case study! In this case study, you will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data
analyst. You will imagine you are working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and
meet different characters and team members. 

### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in theglobal smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat
executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

### Task  

Sršen asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart
devices. She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation. 

Sršen encourages you to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She points you to a specific data set:  

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.


Sršen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help
address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.

### Completion Deadline

### Ask Phase

#### Guiding Questions

1. **What is the problem you are trying to solve?**

I am finding the key patterns on how the consumers of non-Bellabeat products use their health-focused smart-devices.

2. **How can your insights drive business decisions?**

They will help change the marketing strategy of our (Bellabeat's) smart-devices to improve sales.

#### Key tasks

1. **Identify the business task**

The goal of this project is to improve marketing strategy of Bellabeat’s wellness tracker - Leaf Chakra. This project will analyze the usage data of non-Bellabeat trackers’ consumers to find key patterns and relationships. The key insights drawn from the analysis will be applied to Leaf Chakra for its promotion. The final deliverable will be high-level marketing recommendations based on those key insights.

2. **Consider key stakeholders**
